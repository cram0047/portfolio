## What is this Portfolio websit for?

This protfolio website is to show my ringette photography skills.

I created this website using html and css, and using mainly Grid to create the layouts throughout the pages.

### Challenges

Some challenges I faced were:

- I got covid near the due date of the assignment, so completing it was a challenge for a few days, but I started early enough that I still had enough time to complete it.
- I always struggle at first with starting a website, so i had to be very oragnized and start one page at a time and so small parts at a time.
- I had to look up a few things to know how to do something that I coulnd't remember from class instructions.


### What I Learned

I learned to be very orgaizned. I had trouble with previous assignmnets and being orgainzed, so this time I started with small sections and doing one page at a time until it was complete, and then starting a new page. I found this method of doing the website much better for my time management and helped a lot with my anxiety with such a large project. I will definatley follow this routine for future website projects.

### What I used that wasn't mine

- I used the arial font, which is not mine
- All images on the site are mine
