                    <p> JC Photography was founded in 2022 by student photographer Jenny Cram. When she started the business she was in her second semester of the Interactive Media Design program at Algonquin College. She thoroughly enjoyed the photography course in her program which inspired her to photograph ringette. She learned a lot from the photography course, but realised that she needed a batter lens to take even better images. So she has been saving up for a new lens that would be better suited for ringette photography and is doing some photography and other jobs on the side to afford this lens. She has never lost her passion for sports photography even though it has been a challenge at times. She loves photography and the sport and together is a great combination. </p>

                    <p> Jenny started playing ringette when she was about 10 years old and was playing at the u10 age group. She was initially a player but through goalie rotations on her team found out she loved being a goalie, and she was really good at it. During her second year at u10, she was playing on the "C" team and part way through the season was asked to play at the most competitive level at that age the "B" team, which she happily accepted. This decision to be on a more competitive team started her on her competitive ringette journey. Since then, every year she had made the "AA" team, which is the most competitive team starting from u12 to u19 ages.

                    <p> Jenny had received some success in her years playing. In her second year of u12 her team won gold at provincials and was the best team in the province at that age, this really fed her desired to be a champion again. In her second year of u14AA, her and her team won 5 out of 6 round robin games to bring them to the finals of provincials, where they won and became Team Ontario. At u14AA, u16A and u19A, the top three teams go to what is called "Easterns", instead of Nationals like the u16AA and u19AA teams do. They went to "Easterns" and made their way to the bronze medal game and won in overtime. Being the 3rd best team in Eastern Canada. Since then her teams hadn't faired as well, but her love for the sport is what kept her playing for many years, and will keep her playing for many more.
